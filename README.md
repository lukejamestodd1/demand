# demand
Australians get to vote once every three years. How do we know the person we voted for continues to represent our interests after they are elected?

Politicians do not have an incentive to follow the wishes of their electorate between elections. They say one thing to get elected and behave differently in office.

Demand is a polling and data collection tool. It makes politics transparent and accountable by including citizens in the process of policy making between elections. 

1 - Each MP gets a public profile on the platform, each voter gets a private voting account
2 - Voters are asked to vote yes or no on specific bills before they go to parliament
3 - MP votes on the bill in parlaiment in real life
4 - MPs voting results are shown against the polling results for their electorate. Each MP is given a Demand score, showing how consistently they vote with the wishes of their electorate. For example: 'this MP votes with their electorate 78% of the time'. 
5 - MPs voting histories are compared to poll results for their city and state.

Demand is thorough catalogue of each MP's voting history. Future iterations of Demand will show politicians' financial interests, employment history, and business connections.
