# Demand
Australians get to vote once every three years. How do we know the person we voted for continues to represent our interests after they are elected?

Politicians have little incentive to follow the wishes of their electorate between elections. They often say one thing to get elected and behave differently once in office.

Demand makes politics transparent and accountable by including citizens in the process of policy making between elections. It's a polling and data collection tool which gives each MP a score based on how well they represent the interests of their eletorate.

1 - Each MP gets a public profile on the platform, each voter gets a private voting account

2 - Voters are asked to vote yes or no on bills before they go to parliament

3 - MP votes on the bill in parlaiment in real life

4 - MP voting results are compared against polling results for their electorate. Each MP is given a Demand score which shows how consistently they vote with or against their electorate

5 - MPs voting histories are compared to poll results for their region and state


Demand is thorough catalogue of each MP's voting history. Future iterations of the platform will show politicians' financial interests, employment history, business connections and more - in an easy to access format.

Demand better accountability from your elected representitives!
